# Varanasi Solid Waste Management - Route Planning

## Overview
Varanasi city generates around 700 tons of garbage daily. This garbage is collected and transported by garbage collecting vehicles to a dumping ground outside the city on a daily basis. Monitoring is ensured through a GPS system. Using the network of vehicles and GPS systems, this project aims to provide a route planning solution to all garbage collection vehicles to reduce overall costs.

For the purpose of reproducibility, this project was created using Kedro and generated with `Kedro 0.18.5`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

All necessary dependencies are listed in the `src/requirements.txt` file for installation using `pip`.
To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To generate or update the dependency requirements for your project:

```
kedro build-reqs
```

This will `pip-compile` the contents of `src/requirements.txt` into a new file `src/requirements.lock`. You can see the output of the resolution by opening `src/requirements.lock`.

After this, if you'd like to update your project requirements, please update `src/requirements.txt` and re-run `kedro build-reqs`.
