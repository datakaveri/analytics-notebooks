# Jupyter Notebooks for Air Quality Interpolation

This repository contains implementation of various data preprocessing, data imputation, and data interpolation models for time series air quality data which are listed as follows:
- Spatial Kriging or Ordinary Kriging - Performs Ordinary Kringing on sensor data
- Data Synchronization - Gives time synchronized observations from unsynchronized sensor data
- Otliers Detection and Elimination - Detect and eliminates erroneous or noise data
- Data Imputation - Perform imputation (fill missing values in the data) on time series data
- Data Interpolation - Spatio-Tempotal interpolation models

Complete details about each implementation and related informations is given in their respective folders.

## Interpolation of PM2.5 data

The notebooks uses PM2.5 data to implement state-of-the-art models to perform anamoly detection, imputation, and interpolation. However, notebooks can be used for any pollutant. 

## Virtual environments

The complete list of packages and dependencies can be found in yml file in each folder. These files can be used to replicate all the environments for smooth and flawless execuation.
